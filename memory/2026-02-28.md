# 2026-02-28 - Dashboard and Task Board Update

## Decisions
- Populate Kanban board with real tasks from `memory/tasks.json`, using columns: Backlog, Em Progresso, Aguardando, Concluído.
- Implement periodic monitoring cron to scrape AgentMail inbox and update the dashboard automatically.
- Fix the task board rendering by ensuring the static server serves the latest `index.html` and associated assets; add missing `script.js` logic to load tasks from `tasks.json` and render columns dynamically.
- Enhance the Dashboard index page to display summary statistics and recent memories.

## Action Items
1. Create `/data/workspace/dashboard/api/memories` endpoint to fetch memory files (already partially implemented).
2. Add cron job `monitor_agentmail` to run every 30 minutes, parse new emails, and trigger a dashboard refresh.
3. Deploy updated `static/index.html` that loads tasks from `/api/tasks` (or `tasks.json`) and renders columns.
4. Test end‑to‑end flow: new task added → appears on Kanban → persisted in `memory/tasks.json`.

## Current Status
- `taskboard/server.py` handles Basic Auth and serves static files.
- `dashboard/index.html` is minimal; missing dynamic task rendering.
- `memory/tasks.json` holds current task definitions.
- No cron jobs configured yet.

## Next Steps
- Write script to sync `memory/tasks.json` with Kanban board UI.
- Set up heartbeat checks for periodic monitoring.
- Deploy to Railway and verify public URL `https://deep-bugs-float.loca.lt` displays updated board.

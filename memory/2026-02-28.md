## Dashboard Project Overview
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with tables `agents`, `tasks`, `task_events`, `artifacts`.
- **Security**: Basic Auth via `DASH_USER` and `DASH_PASS`; password currently set to `test`.
- **Deployment**: Railway, public URL: `https://deep-bugs-float.loca.lt`.
- **Current Issue**: `/tasks` endpoint returns HTML login page instead of JSON; authentication appears to be failing despite `DASH_USER=admin` being set.
- **Recent Changes**: Added `DASH_USER=admin` and `DASH_PASS=test` to `.env`; restarted gateway; attempted curl with Basic Auth; received HTML response instead of JSON.
- **Next Steps**: Verify that `SETUP_PASSWORD` environment variable is correctly set (`+d1Senha`) and matches the Basic Auth header; ensure all required env vars are exported; restart gateway again; test `/tasks` with proper `Accept: application/json` header.

## Debugging Progress
- Memory sync job completed successfully.
- PostgreSQL contains tasks data (see earlier debug fetch).
- Basic Auth with `admin`/`test` currently not authorized; correct credentials may differ.

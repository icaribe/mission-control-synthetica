- Attempted to install MiniMax M2.1 CLI from `https://kilo.ai/cli`.
- Downloaded HTML page to `~/.local/bin/kilo`; not a runnable binary.
- Tried to execute it, resulting in an HTML document error.
- Search results reveal MiniMax M2.1 is accessible via API (e.g., `model mini_max_m2_1`), but no direct CLI binary found at the URL.
- Next steps: locate official MiniMax M2.1 CLI binary or use API access through appropriate SDK.
